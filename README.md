🦸 Superhero Polymorphism

This project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python using superheroes. It focuses on:

Inheritance → Specialized heroes (Flash, Superman) inherit from a base Superhero class.

Encapsulation → Private attributes (e.g., __speed in Flash).

Polymorphism → Different implementations of the move() method for each superhero.

🚀 How It Works

Superhero → Base class with common attributes and methods.

Flash → Runs super fast ⚡ (overrides move()).

Superman → Flies in the sky 🦅 (overrides move()).

▶️ Run the Program
